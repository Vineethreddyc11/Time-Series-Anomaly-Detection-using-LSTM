# Time Series Anomaly Detection using LSTM
Designed and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder using the Keras API with TensorFlow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index.
Created interactive charts and plots using Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization and displayed results in Jupyter notebooks.


## Introduction

The objective is to explore some of the basic ideas and concepts from time series analysis, and observe their effects when applied to a real world data set. Although it’s not possible to actually predict changes in the index using these techniques, the ideas presented here could theoretically be used as part of a larger strategy involving many additional variables to conduct a regression or machine learning effort.

Time series analysis is a branch of statistics that involves reasoning about ordered sequences of related values in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. It’s used in a wide range of disciplines including econometrics, signal processing, weather forecasting, and basically any other field that involves time series data. These techniques are often used to develop models that can be used to attempt to forecast future values of a series, either on their own or in concert with other variables
