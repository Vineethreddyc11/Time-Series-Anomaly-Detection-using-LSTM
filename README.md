# Web-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection-using-C-LSTM-Neural-Network
Designed and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder using the Keras API with TensorFlow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index.
Created interactive charts and plots using Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization and displayed results in Jupyter notebooks.


## Introduction

Web traffic refers to the amount of data that is sent and received by people visiting online websites.
Web traffic anomalies represent abnormal changes in time series traffic, and it is important to perform
detection quickly and accurately for the efficient operation of complex computer networks systems.
