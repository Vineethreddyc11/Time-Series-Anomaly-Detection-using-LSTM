# Web-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection-using-C-LSTM-Neural-Network
Performed Anomaly Detection for web traffic using C-LSTM which is a combination of CNN to reduce frequency variation in spatial information, LSTM for modeling time information, DNN to map data into more separable space.


## Introduction

Web traffic refers to the amount of data that is sent and received by people visiting online websites.
Web traffic anomalies represent abnormal changes in time series traffic, and it is important to perform
detection quickly and accurately for the efficient operation of complex computer networks systems.
